# **Why Manual Trading Loses to Algorithms**

Stanford research shows that the amygdala - the brain's emotional center -reacts in 12 milliseconds. The prefrontal cortex, responsible for logic - in 500 milliseconds. A 40x difference.

When a trader sees a red candle, their body is already hitting "sell" before the brain can think "this is just normal volatility." This leads to panic sells at the bottom, revenge trades, FOMO buys at the top, and freezing - refusing to close a losing position because "maybe it'll bounce."

Jim Simons made $31 billion through Renaissance Technologies. Citadel, Jane Street, Two Sigma - all of these funds employ teams of quants who develop algorithms. But none of them trade by hand - execution is fully automated. Quants build the systems, machines execute the trades. 99% of manual traders lose money. The successful funds are all algorithmic.

A bot has no amygdala. It doesn't panic, doesn't revenge trade, doesn't stare at the screen. It simply executes the strategy.

# **The RBI System: Three Steps to a Working Bot**

*Every trading bot must go through three stages before launch:*

**Research -> Backtest -> Incubate**

### **Research: Where to Find Trading Ideas**

*The most common mistake is trying to invent a strategy from scratch. The best strategies have already been documented - you just need to know where to look.*

> ***Market Wizards (book series by Jack Schwager)***
> 

3-4 books featuring interviews with the world's best verified traders. Verified - meaning their profits are confirmed. They openly describe their strategies. Available on Audible.

> **Chat with Traders (podcast)**
> 

Free, 300+ episodes. Real traders explaining what works. In terms of raw idea volume - even more than the books, simply due to the sheer number of episodes.

> **Google Scholar**
> 

A free database of academic papers. Searching "mean reversion trading strategies" or "momentum crypto strategies" returns PhD-level research with working strategies in open access.

> **Trading with Small Size**
> 

Trading with minimum stakes ($1-10) - not for profit, but for observation. This is how ideas are born that can later be formalized and tested.

Nothing is new in trading. All ideas already exist - find them, verify them, and automate them.

### **Backtest: X-Ray Vision for Strategies**

***Backtesting means running a strategy against historical data. Not "I think this works" - actual numbers.***

**Why it matters:**

Say there's a strategy with 94% returns on historical data. Without a backtest, the trader doesn't know - they trade, lose, and keep going. A backtest reveals the truth in minutes.

Example results on Polymarket 5-minute markets:

- MACD (3/15/3): **60% win rate**
- RSI + VWAP: **59% win rate**
- CVD divergence: **63% win rate**

What you need**:** data (OHLCV), a backtest engine, and clear strategy rules.

What it shows**:** win rate, profit factor, max drawdown, Sharpe ratio.

*A backtest is not a guarantee. What worked in the past may not work in the future. But it's 100x better than guessing.*

Check every few hours: any errors? Are orders filling? Does P&L match backtest expectations?

### **Incubate: Launch with Minimum Risk**

90% of people get it wrong here - they see good backtest numbers and immediately throw in $10,000.

The right approach: start with $1 on Polymarket, observe for 2-4 weeks, then scale slowly - $1 -> $5 -> $10 -> $50 -> $100.

*Trading is a marathon.*

# **The Practical Part: Building a Bot**

### **Step 1: Install Claude Code**

bash

```
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

*Claude Code is an AI agent that codes directly in the terminal.*

*Input: a task in plain language. Output: working code.*

### **Step 2: Create the Project**

bash

```
mkdir polymarket-rbi-bot &&cd polymarket-rbi-bot
claude
```

*Claude Code is now active. From here - tasks in plain text.*

### **Step 3: Generate the Project Structure**

**Command for Claude Code:**

"Create a Python trading bot project for Polymarket. Structure: strategies/ folder with three strategies (MACD, RSI, CVD), backtesting/ folder with a backtest engine, bot/ folder with a trader and risk manager, deploy/ folder with entry points. Use py-clob-client for the Polymarket API. Limit orders only. Add .env.example, requirements.txt, .gitignore, and README."

Result - a complete project structure in 15-20 minutes:

```

### **Step 4: Connect to Polymarket**

The key file - `polymarket_client.py`. Uses the official SDK `py-clob-client`:

bash

```
pip install py-clob-client
```

python

```
from py_clob_client.clientimport ClobClient
from py_clob_client.clob_typesimport OrderArgs, OrderType
from py_clob_client.order_builder.constantsimport BUY,SELL

# Initialize client
client= ClobClient(
    host="https://clob.polymarket.com",
    key=PRIVATE_KEY,# Wallet private key (from .env)
    chain_id=137,# Polygon mainnet
    funder=FUNDER_ADDRESS,# Wallet address (from .env)
    signature_type=2        # EIP-1271
)

# Create API credentials (once)
client.set_api_creds(client.create_or_derive_api_creds())
```

**Placing a limit order:**

python

```
order_args= OrderArgs(
    price=0.50,# Price (0.01 - 0.99)
    size=1.0,# Size in dollars
    side=BUY,# BUY or SELL
    token_id=TOKEN_ID      # Market token ID
)
signed_order= client.create_order(order_args)
response= client.post_order(signed_order, OrderType.GTC)
```

**Canceling orders (mandatory before placing a new one):**

python

```
open_orders= client.get_orders(market=MARKET_ID,asset_id=TOKEN_ID)
for orderin open_orders:
    client.cancel(order_id=order["id"])
```

**Environment variables (.env):**

text

```
POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
POLYMARKET_FUNDER_ADDRESS=0x...
```

### **Step 5: Three Starter Strategies**

text

```
**MACD Histogram (fast=3, slow=15, signal=3)**
- Entry: MACD line crosses signal line
- Exit: reverse crossover or stop-loss/take-profit
- Works well on trending moves within 5-minute windows

**RSI Mean Reversion (RSI 14)**
- RSI < 30 -> oversold -> long entry
- Exit at RSI > 50 or when price reaches VWAP
- Suited for pullbacks after sharp moves

**CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta)**
- Price-volume divergence -> signal
- Price drops but CVD rises -> buying pressure -> long
- Good for identifying reversal points
```

### **Step 6: Run a Backtest**

bash

```
python deploy/run_backtest.py
```

text

```
Benchmarks for a profitable strategy:
- Win rate > 55%
- Profit factor > 1.5
- Max drawdown < 20%
- At least 100 trades in the sample
```

*If the strategy doesn't pass - move on. Don't get attached to ideas.*

### **Step 7: Launch the Bot in Incubation Mode**

bash

```
python deploy/run_bot.py --strategy macd --size 1 --account account_1
```

*Bot is live with $1 size. Now observe.*

### **Step 8: Parallel Bots**

Multiple bots simultaneously, each in its own terminal:

bash

```
# Terminal 1 — MACD bot
python deploy/run_bot.py --strategy macd --account account_1

# Terminal 2 — RSI bot
python deploy/run_bot.py --strategy rsi --account account_2

# Terminal 3 — CVD bot
python deploy/run_bot.py --strategy cvd --account account_3

# Terminal 4 — monitoring
python deploy/run_monitor.py
```

*Each bot - its own Polymarket account, its own strategy, its own position size.*

### **The Critical Fact About Fees**

On Polymarket, limit orders are **free**. Market orders are not. A bot should always use limit orders only.

Claude Code allows one person to do the work of an entire team: backtests in an hour instead of days, a complete bot in a day instead of weeks, bug fixes in minutes. You can run 3-6 agents in parallel - each working on its own task.

The market doesn't reward effort. It rewards systems.
